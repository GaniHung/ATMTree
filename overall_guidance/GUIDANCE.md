# Project Guidance
## Project Goal

The primary goal is to implement the ATMTree method and compare its performance against the results reported in the RankRAG paper.

## Next Steps

1.  Run the full experiment pipeline using the new `run_experiment.py` script.
2.  Analyze the results and compare them with the RankRAG baseline.
